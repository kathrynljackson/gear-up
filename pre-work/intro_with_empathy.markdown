### Turing Culture: Developing Empathetic Programmers

_Our **mission** is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers._

### Why Empathy?
* Interpersonal skills (including empathy) have a direct, significant impact on your professional success.
* Empathy is a foundational interpersonal skill. Other skills, such as collaboration, communication, compromise all hinge on your ability to demonstrate empathy.
* Interpersonal skills, including empathy, can be developed and improved.
* Turing's mission (cited above) demands that we support students development of technical _and_ interpersonal skills. 

### Pre-Work Preparation
#### Read
Read _two_ of the following articles/videos (we recommend all of them!) and reflect on these questions: why are we talking about empathy at a software development school? how can you develop the "skill" of empathy? and why should you care?

* ["Why is Empathy Important for Design"](http://www.bresslergroup.com/blog/why-empathic-design/)
* ["The Surprising (Nontechnical) Skill You Need to Succeed in Tech"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-surprising-and-nontechnical-skill-you-need-to-succeed-in-tech), _The Muse_

### Reflect
*After reading the articles above, create a gist on Github and reflect (4-6 sentences) on the following prompts.*

#### What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?

I would not describe myself as a naturally empathetic person. Empathy is something that I have had to actively work at as I've grown older. Having autism changes the way I express concern and even changes how I guage situations to measure concern. While most people view empathy as a character trait, I've moreso viewed it as a learning process.


#### How does empathy help you build better software?

Listening emphathetically makes you better at recieving and retaining information. When you listen with empathy, you care about what is being communicated to you. This is especially important in the field of software programming. Our job is to solve and prevent problems. This requires us to be able to fully understand what the goal is in order to create code that makes that goal possible. Often times, the goals are designed and discovered by coworkers from different departments. A software programmer must be able to listen empathetically in order to fully understand the need that they should address in the software.


#### Why is empathy important for working on a team?

Empathy is one of the most important competencies to have in the workforce. This is especially true if you work in a leadership position. Emotional intelligence is necessary for collaboration. Collaboration can be stressful and causes tension between teammates. Being inclusive will help you better understand different points of view and be more considerate when compromise is necessary.


#### Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.

I am a logical thinker to a fault. Having been a teacher, many of my coworkers were very empathetic and often let their emotions guide their decisions. In a field where you are dealing with the mental well-being of children and constantly having to collaborate to co-plan, this is an important skill. Teaching involves a lot of emotions, and learning how to combine empathy with logic helped me to understand which competency was more important to each part of the learning process. Once I became comfortable applying the new skills in my classroom, I was able to apply them to social interactions in the work place. I became much better at working with my team. I was able to use my skills to help other teachers. In return, other teachers became more generous with their time and advice, helping me to become much better at my job.

#### When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios?

I find it difficult to be empathetic towards people's opinions when those opinions affect my plan to complete a process. Sometimes the opinions are simply inocuous parts of converstation. However, when someone in a leadership position asks me to do something that I do not feel is right, it is very for me to respond with their viewpoint in mind. I try to improve this skill by taking some time before I react. I do not naturally think of other people's perspective. Giving my self time before responding gives me a chance to make myself think about their reasoning. This makes it much easier to be empathtic and makes my response more constructive. This also forces me to consider why they may have a better idea than I do.
